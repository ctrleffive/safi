Hygiene depends on your action. Your hand being central to the entire hygiene act, it starts with washing hands. And from there it extends to your whole body.

That being said , Safiâ€™s research has found that there is a lax approach in enforcing hand hygiene. Various reports from WHO (World Health Organization) solidifies this fact. Hand Hygiene along with general hygiene is something which needs to be seriously considered ifthe world has to achieve a healthier generation for Sustainable Development Goals as laid down by the UN.

Safi looks forward to contributing to enabling the need to remain a hygieneic and healthy society by providing an affordable, convenient subscription of cleanliness and hygiene products.
